# ScrabScrap

ScrabScrap is a Raspberry Pi-powered system designed to automatically track Scrabble scores and manage player timers using a camera and physical buttons. The system detects played tiles, calculates points and provides a scrabble-clock timer.

## Features
âœ… **Automated Score Calculation** - Uses a camera to recognize placed Scrabble tiles and compute scores.  
âœ… **Chess-Clock Timer** â€“ Tracks each player's elapsed time.  
âœ… **Physical Controls** â€“ Players interact via hardware buttons connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO.  
âœ… **Compact and Modular Build** â€“ Mounted on a aluminum frame (ALU Profile 20x20) for stability.  
âœ… **WiFi Connectivity** â€“ Enables easy setup and remote access.  
âœ… **Built with Python & React** â€“ Runs seamlessly on a Raspberry Pi.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Raspberry Pi** (Recommended: Raspberry Pi 3b)
- **Camera Module** (for tile detection)
- **Physical Buttons** (for player interactions)
- **Display Module** (to show scores and timers)
- **Aluminum Frame (20x20 ALU Profile)** (for mounting)
